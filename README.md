# mop3-server-sandbox

A node.js server remake for the popular game mope.io using websocket and victor, meant to be compatible with the old mope.io client code

An on and off project that I work on for fun. Currently a WIP with many features in the works.

Used to be a working site / community of 650+ people. I have since deleted my discord & did not renew the domain. Feel free to copy and expand on this!
